# PWC-PowerBi-Task-2 Telecom Customer Retention Dashboard


 This project aims to assist the retention department of a telecom company in improving customer retention strategies by leveraging data-driven insights. The goal is to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that provides a clear, visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer retention.

## Objectives

1. **Define KPIs**: Identify and define relevant KPIs that provide insights into customer retention and risk factors.
2. **Create Dashboard**: Develop a Power BI dashboard reflecting these KPIs, making it easy for the retention manager to visualize and interpret the data.
3. **Provide Recommendations**: Offer actionable suggestions to enhance customer retention strategies based on the dashboard insights.

 ## Problem Statement
The telecom company faces difficulties in maintaining customer retention and effectively managing customer churn. Current methods are reactionary, with insufficient tools for proactive identification of at-risk customers.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this task was presented by [Pwc](https://www.pwc.com) and the call centre trends dataset:

## Insights
**High Churn Rate**: The dashboard indicates a churn rate of 26.54%, suggesting that about one-fourth of the customers are leaving. This is a significant area of concern for the business.

**Yearly Charges**: The yearly revenue from customers is $16.06 million, indicating that even a small increase in the churn rate can result in a substantial financial impact.

**High Churn Risk**: With a 26.54% churn rate, 1,869 customers are at risk, impacting $16.06 million in annual revenue.

**Month-to-Month Contracts**: Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit the highest churn, suggesting the need for promoting longer-term contracts.

**Early Churn**: Most churn occurs within the first year of subscription, indicating the need for enhanced early engagement strategies.

**Payment Method Correlation**: Electronic check users are at higher risk of churn; shifting them to more stable payment methods could help retention.

**Senior Demographic**: Senior citizens (25% of customers) may require tailored engagement to reduce churn.

**Fiber Optic Service**: Higher churn rates are observed among "Fiber Optic" users, potentially due to higher monthly charges.

**Tech Support Issues**: High volumes of tech and admin tickets suggest that service quality improvements are critical.

**Multiple Services**: 50% of customers use multiple lines, showing an opportunity to offer bundled services for improved retention.

**Paperless Billing**: Most customers prefer paperless billing, indicating a readiness for digital engagement strategies.

**First-Year Focus**: Enhancing the customer experience in the first year can significantly reduce churn rates.

The analysis of both dashboards reveals that customer churn is a key challenge, with approximately 26.54% of customers at risk. Month-to-month contracts, higher monthly charges (especially for "Fiber Optic" services), and the use of electronic checks as a payment method are associated with a higher churn rate. The majority of customers who churn tend to do so within their first year of subscription.On the positive side, there is a large segment of customers already utilizing multiple services and paperless billing, indicating a potential pathway to improve retention through bundled services and digital engagement strategies.

To mitigate churn, the company can focus on:

* Encouraging longer-term contracts.
* Improving service quality, especially for "Fiber Optic" customers.
* Enhancing the billing experience by promoting more stable payment methods.
* Providing robust support in the critical first year of customer subscription.
* Addressing technical issues promptly to improve overall customer satisfaction.
