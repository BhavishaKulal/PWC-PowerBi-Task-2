# PWC-PowerBi-Task-2 Telecom Customer Retention Dashboard


 This project aims to assist the retention department of a telecom company in improving customer retention strategies by leveraging data-driven insights. The goal is to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that provides a clear, visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer retention.

## Objectives

1. **Define KPIs**: Identify and define relevant KPIs that provide insights into customer retention and risk factors.
2. **Create Dashboard**: Develop a Power BI dashboard reflecting these KPIs, making it easy for the retention manager to visualize and interpret the data.
3. **Provide Recommendations**: Offer actionable suggestions to enhance customer retention strategies based on the dashboard insights.

 # Problem Statement
The telecom company faces difficulties in maintaining customer retention and effectively managing customer churn. Current methods are reactionary, with insufficient tools for proactive identification of at-risk customers.

#Data Source

The dataset used for this task was presented by [Pwc](https://www.pwc.com) and the call centre trends dataset:

# Insights
**High Churn Rate**: The dashboard indicates a churn rate of 26.54%, suggesting that about one-fourth of the customers are leaving. This is a significant area of concern for the business.

**Yearly Charges**: The yearly revenue from customers is $16.06 million, indicating that even a small increase in the churn rate can result in a substantial financial impact.

**Customer Distribution by Internet Service**:
The majority of customers use "Fiber Optic" services, accounting for 61.73% (3,100) of the total customer base.
DSL and non-Internet service customers make up a smaller proportion, with DSL at around 21.67% (1,500 customers) and non-Internet customers at 34.77% (2,442 customers).

**Contract Length and Churn**:
A majority (47.46%) of the churned customers had month-to-month contracts, suggesting that short-term contracts correlate with higher churn.
Customers with longer contracts (1-year or 2-year) have a notably lower churn rate, implying that commitment to longer-term contracts may help reduce churn.

**Contract Types**:
Most customers have a "Month-to-month" contract, followed by "One year" and "Two year" contracts. The higher churn rate in the "Month-to-month" contract type highlights an opportunity for the company to encourage customers to opt for longer contracts.

**Payment Method Influence**:
Electronic checks are the most common payment method among customers who have churned, indicating a potential link between payment method and customer retention.
Other payment methods like bank transfers, credit cards, and mailed checks seem to have lower churn rates.

**Ticket Analysis**:
The total number of tickets is 7043, with 2955 being "TechTickets" and 3622 as "AdminTickets". This shows that a sizable portion of customer interaction involves technical issues, which might be contributing to dissatisfaction and higher churn.

**Months Subscribed**:
There is a wide distribution in the number of months customers have been subscribed. Analyzing this data further could reveal how customer tenure affects churn risk.

**Churn by Internet Service**:
Customers using "Fiber Optic" services exhibit a relatively high churn rate compared to those using "DSL". This suggests that focusing on service quality and pricing for "Fiber Optic" customers might help reduce churn.
In summary, the dashboard indicates that short-term contracts, high monthly charges (especially for fiber optic users), and electronic check payments are associated with higher churn rates. Strategies to address these areas, such as promoting long-term contracts, improving service quality, and providing flexible payment options, could help in reducing customer churn.
